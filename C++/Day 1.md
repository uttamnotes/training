## **Program Development – Basic Steps**

To write a simple C++ program (for example, to add two numbers), we generally follow these steps:

1. **Start**
2. **Declare variables**
   Allocate memory by declaring variables with appropriate data types.
3. **Display a message**
   Use `cout` to display messages or instructions to the user.
4. **Accept input values**
   Use `cin` to read values from the user.
5. **Perform calculation**
   Carry out the required operation (e.g., sum of two numbers).
6. **Display the result**
   Print the calculated output using `cout`.
7. **End**

## **Basic Structure of a C++ Program**

A C++ program is divided into the following main parts:

1. **Preprocessing Statements**

   * Include required header files
   * Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     ```

2. **Main Function**

   * Execution of the program starts from the `main()` function.

   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       // program body
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Program Body**

   * Contains variable declarations, input/output statements, and logic.

4. **Return Statement**

   * `return 0;` indicates successful execution of the program.

## **Important C++ Statements & Syntax**

### 1. Output Statement (cout)

Used to display output on the screen.

```cpp
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
```

* `<<` : Insertion operator
* `endl` : Moves the cursor to the next line

---

### 2. Variable Declaration

Syntax:

```cpp
datatype variable_name = value;
```

Example:

```cpp
int age = 16;
```

* `int` → data type
* `age` → variable name
* `16` → value assigned

---

### 3. Statement Terminator

* Every C++ statement **must end with a semicolon (`;`)**
* The semicolon acts as a **delimiter**.

Example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
```

---

## **Key Points to Remember**

* `cout` is used for output.
* Variables must be declared before use.
* Every statement ends with `;`
* Program execution starts from `main()`.

If you want, I can also:

* Convert this into **exam-ready notes**
* Add a **simple C++ example program**
* Make it suitable for **high school slides or PDF**
